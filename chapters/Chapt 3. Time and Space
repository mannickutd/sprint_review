## Chapter 3 Time and Space

* Normal day of work is full of interruptions.
* Sprint gives you an excuse to ignore the usual interruptions and focus on blocks of uninterrupted time to work together as a team.
* 6 hours workday.
* 5 consecutitive days for everyone in the team to work together.
* No device rule, no interruptions whether work or not (devices could be used in breaks).
