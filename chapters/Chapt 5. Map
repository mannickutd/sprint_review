## Chapter 5 Map

* By the end of Monday you will have created a simple map which will show customers moving through your service or product.
* The map will provide structure for your solution, sketches and prototype.
* Helps you keep track of how everything fits together, and allows team members to focus on separate parts of the solution.
* "Each map is customer-centric, with a list of key actors on the left. Each map is a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And, no matter the business, each map is simple. The diagrams are composed of nothing more than words, arrows, and a few boxes."
* Map elements:
  1. List the actors (on the left). The "actors" are all the important characters in your story. Most often they're different kinds of customers.
  2. Write the ending (on the right). Its usually easier to figure out the end than the middle of the story.
  3. Words and arrows in between. The map should be functional not a work of art. Words, arrows and the occasional box should be enough.
  4. Keep it simple. Your map should have from five to fifteen steps. By keeping the map simple, the team can agree on structure of the problem without getting caught up on competing solutions.
  5. Ask for help. Creation of the map is a collaborative process, several iterations (and alternating the drawer) of the map is usually needed.
