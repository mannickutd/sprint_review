## Friday

* "Sprints begin with a big challenge, an excellent team - and not much else. By Friday of your sprint week, you've created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But Friday, you'll take it one step further as you interview customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you'll know how far you have to go, and you'll know just what to do next."
