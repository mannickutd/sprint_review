## Chapter 7 Target

* Final task on Monday, after interviewing the experts and organizing your notes, the most important part of your project should jump right out of your map, you should choose a target.
* "Who is the most important customer, and what's the critical moment of that customer's experience?".
* The rest of the week will be focused on the target you choose. Sketching solutions, making a plan, and building a prototype of that moment and the events around it.
* Picking a target, the 'Decider' needs to choose one target customer and one target event on the map. If the 'Decider' wants help, use a straw poll to decide the event.
* Once a target has been selected, there should be an alignment with one of the sprint questions to the target.

* Facilitator notes:
  1. Ask for permission, explain your role with the team in the beginning and make sure everyone is happy with the arrangement.
  2. ABC (Always be capturing), record key ideas on the whiteboard, synthesize and drive the discussion.
  3. Ask obvious questions, help cover the obvious questions so that no one misinterprets discussion.
  4. Take care of humans, you have to act as the energizer for the sprint team. Take frequent breaks, lunch late, eat light and often.
  5. Decide and move on, throughout the week there are many large and small decisions, larger decisions are left to the decider, smaller decisions can be made by the facilitator. Don't let the team dissolve into unproductive debates that aren't moving you toward a decision.
