## Chapter 11 Rumble

* Wednesday morning you will be making a decision to narrow down the most promising sketches. If you cannot decide on one particular winner, there can be winners (2 possibly 3). Choosing to build more than one prototype is called a 'Rumble'.
* Use the method 'Note and Vote' to quickly decide on suitable names for each product prototype.
* 'Note and Vote'
  1. Give each team member a piece of paper and a pen.
  2. Everyone takes three minutes and quietly writes down ideas.
  3. Everyone takes two minutes to self-edit his or her list down to the best two or three ideas.
  4. Write each person's top ideas on the whiteboard. In a sprint with seven people, you'll have roughly fifteen to twenty ideas in all.
  5. Everyone takes two minutes and quietly chooses his or her favourite idea from the whiteboard.
  6. Going around the room, each person calls out his or her favourite. For each 'vote' draw a dot next to the chosen idea on a whiteboard.
  7. The Decider makes the final decision. As always she can choose to follow the votes or not.
