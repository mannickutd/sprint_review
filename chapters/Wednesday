## Wednesday

* " By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That's great, but it's also a problem. You can't prototype and test them all - you need one solid plan. In the morning, you'll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you'll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype."
