## Tuesday

* "On Monday, you and your team defined the challenge and chose the target. On Tuesday you'll come up with solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. Later in the week, the best of these sketches will form the plan for your prototype and test. We hope you had a good night's sleep and a balanced breakfast, because Tuesday is an important day."
