## Chapter 1 Challenge

* "The bigger the challenge the better the sprint"
* 3 situations where sprints can help:
  1. High stakes, a sprint is your chance to check the navigation charts and steer in the right direction before going full steam ahead.
  2. Not Enough Time, deadlines, need a good solution fast.
  3. Just Plain Stuck, important projects are hard to start, momentum can be lost. A fresh approach to problem solving that helps you escape gravity's clutches.
* No problem is too big to tackle in 5 days.
* Sprint forces you to focus on the most pressing questions.
* Sprint allows you to learn from just the surface of a finished product.
* Solve the surface problem (from the customers perspective), move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution.
