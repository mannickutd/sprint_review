## Monday

* "Monday's structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you'll start at the end and agree on a long-term goal. Next, you'll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you'll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you'll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week."
