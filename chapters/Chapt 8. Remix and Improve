## Chapter 8 Remix and Improve

* Begin Tuesday by searching for existing ideas you can use in the afternoon to inform your solution.
* Lightening Demos, your team will take turns giving three minute tours of their favourite solutions: from other products, from different domains, and from within your own company. Each member should be taking notes of other presenters ideas.
* Divide or swarm, if the problem is focused already it is fine for the whole team to work on it together. Otherwise ask each members which part of the problem they would like to work on and divide the problem up that way.
