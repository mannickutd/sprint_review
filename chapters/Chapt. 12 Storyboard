## Chapter 12 Storyboard

* Wednesday afternoon is about making a plan to create the prototype(s).
* See image [storyboard example](https://github.com/mannickutd/sprint_review/blob/master/chapters/storyboard.jpeg).
* Storyboard might look like the world's most boring (and poorly drawn) comic strip.
* Storyboard.
  1. Draw a grid. Draw a bunch of boxes on an empty whiteboard, each about two sheets of paper. Start in the top left hand box. This frame will be the first moment that customers experience on Friday.
  2. Choose an opening scene. "How do customers find out your company exists? Where are they and what are they doing just before they use your product?"
  3. Fill out the storyboard, build out the storyboard one frame at a time. Feel free to skip gaps in frames if it is not critical to the solution. You can come back to filling in the holes at the end.
* Storyboard guidelines.
  1. Work with what you have. Don't try and reinvent new ideas.
  2. Don't write together, your storyboard should include rough headlines and important phrases.
  3. Include just enough detail, who ever picks up this frame shouldn't need to ask 'What happens next? or What goes here?".
  4. The Decider decides, use the Decider to make some quick decisions.
  5. When in doubt -> Take Risks! The sprint is great for testing risky ideas.
  6. Keep the story fifteen minutes or less. Make sure the whole prototype can be tested in fifteen minutes or less.
