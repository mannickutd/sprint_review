## Thursday

* "On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you'll adopt a 'fake it' philosophy to turn that storyboard into a realistic prototype. In the next chapters, we'll explain the mindset, strategy and tools that make it possible to build that prototype in just seven hours."
