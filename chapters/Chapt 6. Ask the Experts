## Chapter 6 Ask the Experts

* Most of Monday afternoon is devoted to an exercise we call 'Ask the Experts'.
* A series of one-at-a-time interviews with people from your sprint team, from around your company, and possibly even an outsider or two with special knowledge.
* For each interview, each member will take notes individually.
* You'll be gathering the information you need to choose the target of your sprint, while gathering fuel for the solutions you sketch on Tuesday.
* Nobody knows everything:
  1. Strategy usually the 'Decider', "What will make this project a success?", "What's our unique advantage or opportunity?", "What's the biggest risk?"
  2. Voice of the customer, "Who can explain the world from their perspective?", whether the person is in sales, customer support or research his or her insights will likely be crucial.
  3. How things work, "who understands the mechanics of your product?".
  4. Previous efforts, often someone at the company has already thought about the problem in detail.
* Conversations should last roughly 30 mins.
* Conversation structure:
  1. Introduce the sprint, team, purpose etc.
  2. Review the whiteboard, give the expert a 2 min tour of the long-term goal, sprint questions and map.
  3. Ask the expert to tell you everything they know about the challenge.
  4. Ask questions, "What opportunities does she see?", "Why?", "Tell me more about that?".
  5. Add sprint questions, change your map, if necessary update the long term goal. The experts are here to tell you what you didn't know.
